**Project: Building a Simple Inventory Management System**

**Business Problem:** A small local bookstore, "Cozy Reads," needs a simple inventory management system to track their books. They want to be able to:

* Add new books to their inventory.
* View the current inventory.
* Update book details (e.g., price, quantity).
* Remove books from the inventory.
* Manage user accounts for employees.

**Technology Stack:**

* Next.js (v13+) for the frontend and backend.
* MongoDB for the database.
* NextAuth.js for authentication.

**Project Goals:**

1.  **Project Setup:** Create a new Next.js project and set up MongoDB.
2.  **Database Schema:** Define a MongoDB schema for the books.
3.  **API Routes:** Create API routes for CRUD operations on the books.
4.  **Frontend UI:** Build a user interface for managing the inventory.
5.  **Authentication:** Implement user authentication and authorization.
6.  **Deployment (Optional):** Deploy the application to a hosting platform.
